# SecureTelecommunicationCompanyNetworkSystem

 The implementation of a network system for a telecommunications company. The project aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
 and availability of data and communication through secure and reliable means. The network will grant access to both wired and wireless
 users to various cloud resources via the Cloud platform.

 # Steps used for the Implementation :
1. Network Design and Beautification: 
         This section covers the overall design of the network and emphasizes the importance of a clean and organized network structure. 
2. Basic Settings to All Devices: 
         This part focuses on the initial basic configuration of network devices, including setting hostnames, passwords, and domain names. 
3. VLANs (for WIRED, WIRELESS & VOICE) Assignment: 
         This part discusses the assignment of Virtual LANs (VLANs) to categorize different types of network traffic, such as wired, wireless, and voice. 
4. EtherChannel, STP Portfast, and BPDUguard Configurations: 
         This section covers configuring features like EtherChannel, spanning tree protocol (STP) Portfast, and BPDUguard to optimize network performance and security. (Loops doesnâ€™t formed) 
5. Subnetting and IP Addressing: 
         This part explains the process of subnetting and assigning IP addresses to different network segments within the enterprise network. 
6. Inter-VLAN Routing on Switches: 
         This section discusses the setup of inter-VLAN routing on multiple switches and the use of DHCP helper addresses for proper IP assignment. 
7. Static IP Address to DMZ/Server Farm Devices: 
         It covers configuring static IP addresses for devices in the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) and server farm for added security. 
8. DHCP Server Device Configurations: 
         This part explains how to configure DHCP servers for dynamic IP address allocation. 
9. OSPF on Firewall, Routers, and Switch: 
         It covers the implementation of the OSPF routing protocol on various network devices, including firewalls, routers, and switches. 
10. Firewall Interface Security Zones and Levels: 
         This section focuses on setting up firewall security zones and levels to control traffic and enhance network security. 
11. Wireless Network Configurations: 
         It discusses the configuration of a wireless LAN controller, including creating wireless LANs for employees and guests and implementing WPA-2 security. 
12. Telephony Service Configuration: 
         This part explains the configuration of telephony services, including assigning IP addresses and line numbers to IP phones. 
13. Verifying and Testing Configurations: 
         The final part emphasizes the importance of verifying and testing all configurations to ensure they work correctly and meet network requirements.
